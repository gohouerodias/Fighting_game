# Fighting_game
Well, I wanted to code a fighting game only with javascript.
I created a todo list to carry out the mini project:
-project Setup ;
-Create player and ennemy ;
-Move characters with event listeners ;
-attacks ;
-health bar Interface ;
-Game timer and game over;

For the interfacing of the game I used assets of which here are the links
Oak Woods Assets: https://brullov.itch.io/oak-woods 
Fighter Asset #1: https://luizmelo.itch.io/martial-hero 
Fighter Asset #2: https://luizmelo.itch.io/martial-hero-2
